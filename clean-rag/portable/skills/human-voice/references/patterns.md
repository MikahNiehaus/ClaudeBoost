# Pattern catalog: quick pass

Every rule SKILL.md's severity list calls P0 or P1, plus the word tiers. Read
this file for any pass. Two companions load on demand:

- `patterns-full.md` — the P2 and judgment-only rules, the stylometric and
  structure tests, and when to rewrite instead of patch. A full audit reads it;
  a quick pass does not.
- `profiles.md` — the six `--context` and five `--voice` profiles, the tolerance
  matrix, and the auto-detection cues. Read it when a context or voice is named
  or inferred.

the gate below, entries marked **Added here**, and the hedging carve-out are
local.

## Before you act on a pattern

A pattern is evidence, not a verdict, and severity is not the only axis. P0 to P2
says how bad a tell is once it is real. This says how much evidence you need
before touching the text at all.

**One sighting is enough** for a P0 tell or a Tier 1A word: a cutoff disclaimer,
a chatbot artifact, a `delve`. Careful human prose rarely produces these.

**A weak tell needs company.** Curly quotes, immaculate typography in a casual
register, one em dash, one hedge, one contrast construction, one reversal. Act
only when several tells share a passage. Where upstream marks a rule *weak* at
its own site, that mark governs.

**Never act on these, whatever else the passage contains:**

- A watched phrase inside a quotation, a title, a proper name, or a passage that
  discusses the phrase rather than uses it. A style guide listing phrases to
  avoid is the common case, and every entry on its list is a false positive.
- A salutation or sign-off on a letter or comment. Those predate chatbots.
- Text written before 30 November 2022.

**Keep what carries the writer's voice**, even where a rule would fire: a
specific unusual detail; mixed feelings and unresolved tension; dated, era-bound
references; a first-person choice the writer can explain; a genuine aside,
parenthetical, or self-correction.

Judging by feel does little better than chance, and human writing keeps absorbing
AI habits, so several tells together are the safeguard. Adapted from
`blader/humanizer` ("When not to act").

## What to remove or fix

### Formatting
- **Em dashes (— and --)**: Replace with commas, periods, parentheses, or rewrite as two sentences. Target: zero. Hard max: one per 1,000 words. This applies to headings and section titles too, not just body prose. Catch both the Unicode em dash (—) and the double-hyphen substitute (--). Carve-out: an em dash acting as the separator in a bulleted or numbered list item that opens with a bolded lead term or a markdown link (`- **Term** — description`, `- [label](url) — description`) is typography, not a prose splice — don't count it toward the rate. Only the list-item form qualifies: a mid-sentence splice still counts, as does a line-initial `**Bold lead** — full sentence` outside a list (itself an AI tell), and the double-hyphen substitute is never carved out.
- **Bold overuse**: Strip bold from most phrases. One bolded phrase per major section at most, or none. If something's important enough to bold, restructure the sentence to lead with it instead.
- **Emoji in headers**: Remove entirely. No `## 🚀 What This Means`. Exception: social posts may use one or two emoji sparingly — at the end of a line, never mid-sentence.
- **Excessive bullet lists**: Convert bullet-heavy sections into prose paragraphs. Bullets only for genuinely list-like content (feature comparisons, step-by-step instructions, API parameters).
- **Curly quotation marks (“ ” ‘ ’) and apostrophes**: Curly quotes and apostrophes (U+201C/U+201D, U+2018/U+2019) are a *weak* paste-from-chat signal — meaningful mainly in plain-text contexts like code comments, commit messages, or plaintext drafts, where nothing auto-curls. Treat as corroborating, never conclusive: Word, Google Docs, macOS, and iOS curl quotes by default, so most human prose contains them too. Don't flag curly apostrophes (U+2019) on their own. Replace with straight quotes in plain-text/code; leave them in finished publications and locale-correct punctuation (French « », German „ “).
- **Immaculate typography in casual registers**: Same tier as curly quotes — a *weak*, register-scoped signal, never conclusive alone. Perfect spacing, punctuation, and capitalization in a context where humans type fast (issue/PR comments, chat, DMs) is corroborating evidence, not proof: a careful human can type a flawless comment, and a rushed one can type a sloppy one. Judge it alongside other signals. Inverse case worth flagging the other direction: when editing a human's casual text (a Slack message, a quick reply), preserve their typos, contractions, and idiosyncratic capitalization rather than correcting them — smoothing away the rough edges erases the fingerprint that marks the text as theirs.

### Sentence structure
- **"It's not X — it's Y" / "This isn't about X, it's about Y"**: Rewrite as a direct positive statement. Max one per piece, and only if it serves the argument. This includes the **split-sentence form**, where the negation and the correction fall in two separate sentences rather than pivoting on a single dash or comma: "The headline isn't the speed. The real story is Y." Read on its own, each sentence looks like an innocent declarative, which is exactly why the split version slips past a check tuned to the joined phrasing — flag it the same way. AI also stacks the negation across several options before the reveal ("It's not the price. It's not the features. It's the trust."). The multi-negation countdown is the same move inflated; flag it and cut straight to the positive claim. The **tailing negation** is the clipped cousin: a bare negation fragment tacked onto the end of a sentence — "The options come from the selected item, no guessing." Write the constraint as a real clause ("without forcing the user to guess") or cut it. Carve-out: negations enumerating spec constraints in a list ("no dependencies, no telemetry") are list content, not a reveal. Adapted from `blader/humanizer` P9.
- **Hollow intensifiers**: Cut `genuine` / `genuinely`, `real` (as in "a real improvement"), `truly`, `quite frankly`, `to be honest`, `let's be clear`, `it's worth noting that`, and `actually` when it only adds emphasis. The default fix for `actually` is deletion, not substitution: "This actually makes the process simpler" becomes "This makes the process simpler." Keep it when it marks a specific correction or expectation gap the sentence names ("we expected a cache hit; it was actually a miss"), though a direct contrast may still be clearer ("it was a miss, not a hit"). Just state the fact.
- **Vague endorsement ("worth [verb]ing")**: Cut or replace `worth reading`, `worth paying attention to`, `worth a look`, `worth exploring`, `worth checking out`, `worth your time`. These substitute a generic thumbs-up for a specific reason. Say *why* something matters instead.
- **Hedging**: Cut `perhaps`, `could potentially`, `it's important to note that`, `to be clear`. Make the point directly. **Carve-out, matching the `actually` entry above: keep the hedge when it carries uncertainty the writer has not resolved.** "The root cause could potentially be a race in the writer thread, though we have not reproduced it" reports a confidence level; deleting the hedge asserts a fact the source never claimed, which is a worse defect than the hedge. Cut the throat-clearing wrapper and keep the epistemic content: "we think the root cause is a race in the writer thread, unconfirmed." Never trade accuracy for register. `profiles.md` relaxes this rule on `technical-blog` for the same reason. (Carve-out added here.)
- **Missing bridge sentences**: Each paragraph should connect to the last. If paragraphs could be rearranged without the reader noticing, add connective tissue.
- **Compulsive rule of three**: Vary groupings. Use two items, four items, or a full sentence instead of triads. Max one "adjective, adjective, and adjective" pattern per piece.

### Words and phrases to replace

Words are organized into three tiers based on how reliably they signal AI-generated text. This tiered approach — adapted from [brandonwise/humanizer](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer)'s vocabulary research — reduces false positives on words that are fine in isolation but suspicious in clusters.

- **Tier 1 — Always flag.** These words appear 5–20x more often in AI text than human text. Replace on sight.
- **Tier 2 — Flag in clusters.** Individually fine, but two or more in the same paragraph is a strong AI signal. Flag when they appear together.
- **Tier 3 — Flag by density.** Common words that AI simply overuses. Only flag when they make up a noticeable fraction of the text (roughly 3%+ of total words).

**Match inflected forms.** Each entry below covers the listed word *and its morphological variants* — adverb (`-ly`), gerund/participle (`-ing`), plural, comparative/superlative, and verb conjugations — unless a variant carries a distinct, legitimate meaning. So `genuine` also flags `genuinely`, `leverage` also flags `leveraging` / `leveraged`, `delve` covers `delving`, and `meticulous` covers `meticulously`. When a variant has a separate honest sense (e.g. `real` meaning factual, not the intensifier in "a real improvement"), judge by context rather than matching blindly.

#### Tier 1 — Always replace

Tier 1 splits into two bands. **Both are always replaced**; the edit is the same. What differs is what a flag *means*.

**1A — AI frequency markers.** Words claimed to appear far more often in machine text than in human writing. A cluster of these is evidence about how a passage was produced.

**1B — Clarity edits.** Wordiness and inflated formality. Replacing them is good writing regardless of who wrote the sentence, and a 1B hit is **not** evidence of machine authorship. Measured against 257 paragraphs of verified pre-2023 human prose, 1B entries fire on ordinary professional and formal writing at a meaningful rate — `in order to`, `utilize`, `commence`, `ascertain`, and `endeavor` are simply the words some people reach for. The detector emits these as `tier1-clarity`, weights them like Tier 2, and excludes them from the dense-AI-vocabulary signal so a wordiness fix can never push a document toward an AI classification.

In `detect` mode, report the two bands separately. Presenting a wordiness fix as authorship evidence is the error this split exists to prevent.

Caveat worth keeping visible: the "appears far more often in AI text" claim behind 1A is **inherited, not measured here**. It traces to [brandonwise/humanizer](https://github.com/brandonwise/humanizer), which states a 5–20x ratio without publishing a method or dataset. Treat 1A as a well-supported convention rather than a verified statistic until this repo measures the ratios itself against a machine-written corpus.

**Added here.** The last two rows come from ClaudeBoost's own Stop hook
(`<repo root>/scripts/human-voice-guard.py`, outside this skill), which blocks an
assistant message outright rather than nudging. A word that blocks has to appear
in this table, or a message gets refused for a word the skill never raised. That
hook's list is this tier's floor, and a test in the same repo fails if the two
drift apart. Both rows stand on their own as AI markers, so they stay correct
wherever this skill is installed, with or without that hook.

**Hyphen required:** unhyphenated "load bearing" is ordinary English ("the load bearing down on the bridge") — only the hyphenated compound is the tell.

**Abstract-noun boundary:** Flag hyphenated `load-bearing` only when it immediately modifies, on the same line, `assumption`, `claim`, `invariant`, `premise`, `constraint`, `dependency`, `argument`, or `abstraction` (including plurals). Preserve literal building terminology, unlisted nouns, intervening modifiers, and predicative uses such as "the wall in the kitchen is load-bearing" or "that claim is load-bearing." Mixed physical/abstract nouns (`structure`, `element`, `frame`, `foundation`, `test`, `detail`) also pass. This deliberately misses some metaphors to avoid flagging ordinary writing; see issue #56.

##### Tier 1B — Clarity edits

Wordiness and formality, not authorship evidence. Same fix, weaker claim.

| Replace | With |
|---|---|
| utilize | use |
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| serves as | is |
| features (verb) | has, includes |
| boasts | has |
| presents (inflated) | is, shows, gives |
| commence | start, begin |
| ascertain | find out, determine, learn |
| endeavor | effort, attempt, try |

#### Tier 2 — Flag when 2+ appear in the same paragraph

These words are legitimate on their own. When two or more show up together, the paragraph likely needs a rewrite.

| Replace | With |
|---|---|
| harness | use, take advantage of |
| navigate / navigating | work through, handle, deal with |
| foster | encourage, support, build |
| elevate | improve, raise, strengthen |
| unleash | release, enable, unlock |
| streamline | simplify, speed up |
| empower | enable, let, allow |
| bolster | support, strengthen, back up |
| spearhead | lead, drive, run |
| resonate / resonates with | connect with, appeal to, matter to |
| revolutionize | change, transform, reshape (or describe what changed) |
| facilitate / facilitates | enable, help, allow, run |
| underpin | support, form the basis of |
| nuanced | specific, subtle, detailed (or name the actual nuance) |
| crucial | important, key, necessary |
| multifaceted | (describe the actual facets, or cut) |
| ecosystem (metaphor) | system, community, network, market |
| myriad | many, numerous (or give a number) |
| plethora | many, a lot of (or give a number) |
| encompass | include, cover, span |
| catalyze | start, trigger, accelerate |
| reimagine | rethink, redesign, rebuild |
| galvanize | motivate, rally, push |
| augment | add to, expand, supplement |
| cultivate | build, develop, grow |
| illuminate | clarify, explain, show |
| elucidate | explain, clarify, spell out |
| juxtapose | compare, contrast, set side by side |
| paradigm-shifting | (describe what actually shifted) |
| transformative / transformation | (describe what changed and how) |
| cornerstone | foundation, basis, key part |
| paramount | most important, top priority |
| poised (to) | ready, set, about to |
| burgeoning | growing, emerging (or cite a number) |
| nascent | new, early-stage, emerging |
| quintessential | typical, classic, defining |
| overarching | main, central, broad |
| quietly | cut, or name the concrete contrast |
| deeply *(significance collocations only — "deeply integrated," "deeply committed," "deeply rooted"; literal uses like "deeply nested" or "cares deeply" never count toward a cluster)* | cut, or name what specifically runs deep |
| underpinning / underpinnings | basis, foundation, what supports |

#### Tier 3 — Flag only at high density

These are normal words. Only flag them when the text is saturated with them — a sign that AI filled space with vague praise instead of specifics.

| Word | What to do |
|---|---|
| significant / significantly | Replace some with specifics: numbers, comparisons, examples |
| innovative / innovation | Describe what's actually new |
| effective / effectively | Say how or cite a metric |
| dynamic / dynamics | Name the actual forces or changes |
| scalable / scalability | Describe what scales and to what |
| compelling | Say why it compels |
| unprecedented | Name the precedent it breaks (or cut) |
| exceptional / exceptionally | Cite what makes it an exception |
| remarkable / remarkably | Say what's worth remarking on |
| sophisticated | Describe the sophistication |
| instrumental | Say what role it played |
| world-class / state-of-the-art / best-in-class | Cite a benchmark or comparison |
| verbatim | Usually redundant with the verb ("copies X verbatim" = "copies X") — cut it. If the exactness marks a contrast, name it: byte-for-byte, word for word, unchanged. Term of art in legal/research/QA registers ("verbatim transcript / record / testimony"), so weigh density in that context before flagging |

#### Tier 3 phrases — Flag at density or in clusters

Multi-word boilerplate that's individually unobjectionable but stacks heavily in AI-generated content (crypto, web3, DePIN, AI/infra reviews are the worst offenders). Flag at **2+ uses of the same phrase** (the per-phrase rule — lower threshold than single-word Tier 3 because a two-word match repeated twice is already stronger evidence than re-using "significant"), *plus* a **cluster rule**: three or more *distinct* phrases from this table in one piece is a strong signal even when each phrase only appears once — that's the shape LLMs take when they vary their own boilerplate to seem less repetitive.

| Phrase | What to do |
|---|---|
| emerging sector / emerging space / emerging category | Name the actual sector or what's emerging about it |
| the integration of (X with Y) | Describe what's being integrated and what changes for the user |
| the intersection of (X and Y) | Pick the specific overlap that matters or cut the framing |
| community-driven | Name what the community does. "Community-driven" alone is filler |
| long-term sustainability | Cite the time horizon and the constraint. "Long-term" is hand-waving |
| user engagement | Name the action. "Engagement" is a wrapper around clicks/comments/retention |
| decentralized compute | Specify the architecture or cut. The phrase has become a category label, not a claim |
| (sustainable) reward emissions | Cite the emission schedule and the sink |
| tokenized incentive structures | Describe the actual mechanism (vesting, gauge, bonded LP, etc.) |
| designed for long-term [X] | Cut "designed for" — either it is or it isn't. Then state the property |

#### Audience-fit note: domain-term collision (judgment only)

In cryptography writing, flag generic "proof" or "proof point" only when a reader could mistake supporting evidence for a cryptographic proof. This is a P2 clarity check, outside the vocabulary tiers and deterministic phrase table. Preserve literal cryptographic proofs, ordinary "proof of purchase," and strategy uses whose meaning is clear. Adapted from `welttowelt/stop-slop-refined` ([#108](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/avoid-ai-writing/issues/108)).

| Ambiguous use | Clarify using source facts |
|---|---|
| "The launch is our proof" in a discussion of cryptographic guarantees | "The launch is evidence of demand" only if demand is the claim being supported; otherwise ask what the launch demonstrates. |
| "This demo is our proof point" when readers could infer a security proof | Name what the demo demonstrates; preserve "proof point" when the passage already distinguishes it from a cryptographic proof. |

### Template phrases (avoid)

These slot-fill constructions signal that a sentence was generated, not written. If a phrase has a blank where a noun or adjective could go and still sound the same, it's too generic.

- "a [adjective] step towards [adjective] AI infrastructure" → describe the specific capability, benchmark, or outcome
- "a [adjective] step forward for [noun]" → same rule: say what actually changed
- "Whether you're [X] or [Y]" → false-breadth construction. Pick the audience you're actually addressing, or cut. "Whether you're a startup founder or an enterprise architect" means nothing — it's just "everyone."
- "I recently had the pleasure of [verb]-ing" → review/social AI pattern. Just say what happened: "I talked to," "I read," "I attended."

### Structural issues
- **Uniform paragraph length**: Vary deliberately. Include some 1-2 sentence paragraphs and some longer ones. If every paragraph is roughly the same size, fix it.
- **Formulaic openings**: If the piece opens with broad context before getting to the point ("In the rapidly evolving world of..."), rewrite to lead with the news or the insight. Context can come second.
- **Suspiciously clean grammar**: Don't sand away all personality. Deliberate fragments, sentences starting with "And" or "But," comma splices for effect: if the natural voice uses them, keep them.

### Significance inflation
- Phrases like "marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of..." or "a watershed moment for the industry" inflate routine events into history-making ones. State what happened and let the reader judge significance.
- If the sentence still works after you delete the inflation clause, delete it.

### Generic future-narrative closers
- "May become one of the most important narratives of the next market cycle," "could become the defining trend of the coming decade," "is poised to become the next major chapter in [X]." AI defaults to this shape when it needs to land a closing thought without committing to a falsifiable claim. The closer is grammatically a prediction but contains no testable content.
- Pattern: modal (may / could / will / is poised to) + "become" + (one of) the most [adjective] + (narrative / story / trend / theme / chapter / movement / force).
- Fix: pick the falsifiable version. "DePIN compute may exceed AWS spot pricing for embarrassingly parallel workloads by 2027" is a prediction. "The intersection of AI and DePIN may become one of the most important narratives of the next market cycle" is not.

### Hedge-stacked predictions
- Stacking a modal with a hedge adverb: "could potentially create," "may eventually unlock," "might ultimately transform." Either word alone is acceptable; the stack is the tell. Each hedge cancels the next, leaving a sentence that asserts nothing while sounding cautious and thoughtful.
- Fix: pick one. If you mean "could create," say that. If you mean "potentially creates," say that. Both together is filler.

### "Real/actual" adjective inflation
- "Real on-chain tokenomics," "actual reward sustainability," "genuine utility," "true product-market fit." Using `real` / `actual` / `genuine` / `true` as an empty intensifier on an abstract noun implies the rest of the field is fake or superficial — without naming what makes this instance the real one. Common in crypto/AI/web3 content where the writer wants to signal sophistication.
- Distinct from the existing "hollow intensifiers" rule (genuine / truly / quite frankly as sentence-level hedges). This is the noun-modifier form, where the intensifier latches onto an abstract noun to manufacture a contrast that goes unsaid.
- **Carve-out — named contrast:** if the sentence explicitly names what the fake/superficial version is, leave it. "Real on-chain settlement, not bridged IOUs" or "actual revenue from paying customers, not grants" is honest contrastive writing. The AI tell is the unsaid contrast.
- Fix when no contrast is named: drop the adjective and add the specific claim. "Reward sustainability" → "rewards funded from $X/mo in fees rather than emissions."

### Moral-adjective category errors
- AI glues moral or character adjectives (`honest`, `genuine`, `faithful`, `truthful`) onto non-agentic technical nouns (`shape`, `number`, `representation`, `accuracy`, `curve`, `output`) where the adjective cannot literally modify the noun. "An honest shape" — shapes are not moral agents; it is a category error. The same move appears as the adverb form: "described honestly," "flagged honestly" — the passive voice hides that there is no subject capable of honesty.
- **Fix:** state the concrete property instead of the moral one. "An honest shape" → "a more realistic curve." "A more honest representation" → "a clearer picture." Cut moral adverbs from passive constructions entirely — "flagged honestly" → "noted." Let the evidence carry the honesty claim.
- **Related — ontological slop on assumptions:** "The assumption stops being true." Assumptions do not flip from true to false; they degrade in adequacy. Write "the assumption breaks down" or "no longer holds."
- **Related — gratuitous universal quantifiers:** "Taught in every first-year biochemistry course" instead of "taught in introductory biochemistry." The universal claim ("every") is unverifiable and unnecessary — it borrows authority from a scope the writer cannot check. Replace with the actual scope or drop the quantifier.

### Hashtag stuffing
- Long trailing hashtag blocks (6+ hashtags on a single short post) are near-universal in LLM-generated social content and rare in thoughtful human posts. The block usually mixes a project-specific tag with broad category tags (#AI #Crypto #Web3 #Innovation #FutureTech #Technology) — the categorical ones do nothing for discoverability and read as bot output.
- **Why 6?** Empirical floor. LinkedIn and X organic engagement plateaus or declines past 3-5 tags; human posts that exceed 5 are usually launch posts trading reach for engagement, while LLM-generated posts default to 10-15. Six is the threshold where false positives on legitimate human use start dropping below false negatives on AI output. The detector treats 6+ as a hard flag; the spec treats 5+ as a soft tell worth a second look on `linkedin` and `investor-email` profiles.
- **What doesn't count.** A `#` in technical prose is usually not a tag. Issue and PR references (`#88`, `#1234`), 6- and 8-character CSS hex colours that contain a digit (`#1a2b3c`), C preprocessor directives (`#include`), URL fragments, `owner/repo#88`, Markdown headings, and anything inside a code span or fence are all subtracted before the threshold applies. Short hex-shaped words stay counted, because `#fff`, `#dad`, `#b2b` and `#decade` are also real tags. A channel name (`#general`) is the same token as a tag and stays counted too, since separating them needs a guess about intent.
- Fix: 2-3 specific tags max, or none. If a hashtag wouldn't help a reader find related work, it's filler.

### Bullet lists of bare noun phrases
- A list of 5+ consecutive bullet items where each item is a short (≤6 word) adjective-plus-noun phrase with no verb. "Stable mining efficiency / Reliable pool connectivity / Optimized RandomX performance / Low failed share rates / Effective hardware utilization / Consistent thermal stability." Reads as a marketing one-pager because that's the shape LLMs default to when asked to summarize features.
- The tell is the *symmetry*: every item is the same grammatical shape, every item is parallel in length, none of them assert anything checkable. A genuine list of observations would have varying length, occasional verbs, and at least one item that doesn't fit the pattern.
- Fix: convert to prose paragraph, or rewrite items as full claims ("Failed shares stayed under 1% across a 12-hour run" beats "Low failed share rates"). If the list is genuinely the right form, vary the items so each carries a different shape of information.
- This rule does *not* apply to genuine list content (changelog entries, todo lists, parameter docs, ingredient lists) where bare noun phrases are the correct form. The detector keys on absence of finite verbs to separate the two — but in prose audits, ask whether the bullets are summarizing claims (rewrite) or enumerating items (leave).

### Synonym cycling
- AI rotates synonyms to avoid repeating a word: "developers... engineers... practitioners... builders" in the same paragraph. Human writers repeat the clearest word.
- If the same noun or verb appears three times in a paragraph and that's the right word, keep all three. Forced variation reads as thesaurus abuse.

### Vague attributions
- "Experts believe," "Studies show," "Research suggests," "Industry leaders agree" — without naming the expert, study, or leader. Either cite a specific source or drop the attribution and state the claim directly.

### Chatbot artifacts
- "I hope this helps!", "Certainly!", "Absolutely!", "Great question!", "Feel free to reach out," "Let me know if you need anything else" — these are conversational tics from chat interfaces, not writing. Remove entirely.
- Also watch for: "In this article, we will explore..." or "Let's dive in!" — these are AI-generated meta-narration. Cut or rewrite with a direct opening.

### "Let's" constructions
- "Let's explore," "Let's take a look," "Let's break this down," "Let's examine" — AI uses "let's" as a false-collaborative opener to ease into a topic. It's filler that delays the actual point. Just start with the point. "Let's dive in" is covered above under chatbot artifacts, but the pattern is broader than that — flag any "let's + verb" that's functioning as a transition rather than a genuine invitation to act.

### Cutoff disclaimers
- "While specific details are limited based on available information," "As of my last update," "I don't have access to real-time data." These are model limitations leaking into prose. Either find the information or remove the hedge. Never publish a sentence that admits the writer didn't look something up.

### Infomercial engagement hooks
- Punchy fragment-hooks that tee up a reveal: "The catch?", "The kicker?", "Here's the thing.", "But here's the kicker:", "The best part?", "Plot twist:", "The result?". AI uses these to fake momentum and manufacture suspense around ordinary information — the prose equivalent of a late-night infomercial.
- Distinct from rhetorical-question openers (which stall before a point) and chatbot artifacts (which perform helpfulness): these are mid-flow teasers that pad the rhythm. The fix is to delete the hook and state the thing. "The catch? It only works on weekends." becomes "It only works on weekends." Adapted from `Aboudjem/humanizer-skill` P41.
- The same move in a fake-candid register: "Honestly?", "Look,", "Real talk:", "Let's be honest —" as standalone openers that stage a pause before an ordinary point. The tell is the theatrical setup-and-reveal, not the word — "honestly" or "look" mid-sentence in casual prose is ordinary English and stays unflagged. Adapted from `blader/humanizer` P33.

### Social endorsement closers
- The curatorial sign-off LLMs append to LinkedIn and X posts that share or recommend something — usually a colon teeing up a link: "This one is worth your time:", "This one's a must-read:", "I highly recommend giving this a read.", "Do yourself a favor and read this.", "You won't want to miss this one.", "Save this for later.", "Bookmark this.", "Don't sleep on this one.", "Trust me, you'll want to read this.", "Thank me later."
- Why it's a tell: it performs a recommendation without giving the reader a reason to click. The endorsement is generic and demonstrative-anchored ("THIS one is worth your time") — it could sit under any link, which is exactly why an LLM reaches for it to close a share post.
- Distinct from the bare "worth [verb]ing" word-table entry (a single weak word inside a sentence) and from infomercial engagement hooks (mid-flow teasers like "The catch?"): this is the whole closing line of a social post.
- The fix: say *what* the thing is and *who* it's for, then drop the CTA. "This one is worth your time:" becomes "Sarah's breakdown of why context windows leak — the clearest explanation I've found for anyone debugging RAG pipelines." If you can't name a specific reason, the share doesn't need a sign-off at all; let the link stand on its own.

### Lingering-attention claims
- The share-post frame that claims a thing has occupied the writer's mind: "the line I keep coming back to," "I can't stop thinking about this," "still thinking about this one," "this has been rattling around in my head all week," "I've been chewing on this since Tuesday." The claim is about the writer's attention, not about the thing, and it arrives *before* the reader has any reason to care.
- Distinct from emotional flatline, which claims a **feeling** ("What surprised me most"). This claims **duration** of attention, which is unfalsifiable and self-flattering in a way a feeling isn't: nobody can check whether you kept coming back to it, and the frame implies the quote earned repeat visits without showing what it earned them with. Also distinct from social endorsement closers, which vouch for a link at the end of a post; this opens one.
- **Carve-out — reason attached.** Leave it when the sentence says *why* the thing recurred: "I keep coming back to Hirschman's exit-voice framing because it predicts which engineers quit and which ones file the RFC." That's a claim about the idea's explanatory reach. The tell is the bare frame with the reason missing.
- Fix: delete the frame and open on the thing itself. "The line I keep coming back to: agents are teenagers." becomes "Jeetu describes AI agents as teenagers." The quote either lands or it doesn't, and the frame doesn't change which.

### Invented contrast-pair mirroring
- An AI-specific form of forced symmetry: one half of a contrast pair is a legitimate term of art, and the other is the AI inventing its mirror to balance the sentence. "False precision rather than genuine accuracy" — "false precision" is a real statistical term; "genuine accuracy" is a phantom counterpart generated for parallelism. The asymmetry is invisible unless you know which half is real. The same pattern can produce pairs like "real data rather than theoretical models" (both real) or "practical results rather than abstract speculation" (both real), but the AI-specific tell is when one term is borrowed from the domain and the other is entirely fabricated.
- **Fix:** if you need a contrast, reach for an actual opposite. If no real opposite exists, drop the contrast structure and state the positive claim directly. "May create a misleadingly exact number rather than a more accurate one" — the contrast works because both halves are real descriptions.

### Narrated candor
- Announcing your own disclosure instead of disclosing: "Two caveats I would rather flag than let you discover later:", "I want to be upfront:", "To be fully transparent:", "Rather than bury this, I'll say it plainly:", "I could have left this out, but:", "Being honest about the limitations here:". The content is "Two caveats:"; the rest advertises the writer's forthrightness.
- Completes the set with two neighbours. Chatbot artifacts perform **helpfulness** ("I hope this helps!"); sycophantic tone validates **the reader** ("Great question!"); this performs **candor about oneself**. Assistant training rewards visible transparency, so the model narrates being forthcoming rather than simply being it.
- Note the shape is usually a matched antithesis (flag rather than let you discover, say plainly rather than bury), which is its own tell — the symmetry is doing the work that content should.
- **The deletion test.** Cut the frame. If the sentence loses no information, it was never content: "Two caveats I would rather flag than let you discover later: X and Y" and "Two caveats: X and Y" say the same thing.
- **Carve-out — the disclosure itself.** Substantive admissions stay, and are the point: "I haven't tested this on Windows", "the numbers in the commit message don't reproduce on my hardware", "this is a mitigation, not a fix". Those carry information. The tell is the separable clause *about* disclosing, not the disclosure.
- **Carve-out — conflict-of-interest disclosure.** "In the interest of full disclosure, I own shares in the company discussed here" is not narrated candor. In journalism, academia, finance, and open-source governance that opening is the conventional label that makes a disclosure legible, and the sentence carries the material fact. Leave it. The same words with nothing behind them ("in the interest of full disclosure, I want to be upfront about my thinking here") are the tell.
- **Not the ordinary comparative.** "I'd rather fix it than let you inherit the mess" is a preference about work, not an announcement about disclosing. The construction only counts when what follows the frame is the *disclosure itself*.
- **Judgment-only, deliberately.** This was implemented as a detector and reverted: every regex tight enough to spare the two carve-outs above stopped matching the tell, and the phrasings are shared with idiomatic disclosure language. Deciding it requires reading whether the clause carries information or only announces that information is coming, which is what a reader can do and a pattern cannot.
